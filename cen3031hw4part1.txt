How the router makes use of the controllers to determine the flow of request handling?
	-first it includes the 2 controller files
	-includes express
	-if it has '/' then call functions from the listings.server.controller file
	-if it has '/:listingID' then call functions from the same file 
	-again, if a parameter is specified, a function from the same file is called
	-coordinates.server.controller is used to receive the coordinates

How middleware is used throughout the application to modularize the code?
	-middleware is used to call a function/check errors before passing a request
